# ZenithProxy

[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nJZrSaRKtb)

Minecraft 1.20.1 proxy/bot intended for use on 2b2t.org. 

The primary purpose is to have Minecraft accounts always online and securely shared by multiple people.

This project is also used to support the [2b2t.vc API](https://api.2b2t.vc) and [Discord Bot](https://bot.2b2t.vc).

<details>
    <summary>What is a proxy?</summary>

    This proxy itself consists of two components:
    1. A Minecraft Server ("Proxy Server")
    2. A Minecraft Client ("Proxy Client")

    Players use a Minecraft client to connect to the Proxy Server as you would a normal MC server.
    The Proxy Client connects to a destination MC server (i.e. 2b2t.org).
    The Player's packets to the Proxy Server get forwarded to the Proxy Client which forwards them to the destination
    MC server.
    
    Player MC Client -> Proxy Server -> Proxy Client -> MC Server
    
    When no Player Client is connected the Proxy Client can still act as a bot: moving around, chatting, etc.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How does it work?</summary>

    The Proxy caches the client's world state including chunks, entities, other players, etc. to allow Player Clients to connect at any time.

    The Proxy is also able to read/modify/cancel/send arbitrary packets in either direction at any time. This is used to simulate
    player movements, spectator mode, discord chat relay, and more.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. Linux or Windows computer. I recommend DigitalOcean's `1 GB Memory / 1 vCPU` VPS in NYC-1 for
   minimal ping to 2b2t. 2b2t allows a maximum of 3 accounts concurrently connected per IP address.
   [Free DigitalOcean $200 credit for new accounts](https://m.do.co/c/3a3a226e4936).
2. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

## Setup

1. Download `ZenithProxyLauncher.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/rfresh2/ZenithProxy/releases/launcher) and unzip to a new folder. 
OR clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:rfresh2/ZenithProxy.git`
2. Open a terminal in the directory, run `python3 setup.py`, and follow the prompts. (if `python3` is not recognized, try `python` or `py`)

### Release Channels

ZenithProxy has 3 release channels:

* (Default) `java` - Supports all operating systems
  * Requires Java 21+. [Java Downloads](https://adoptium.net/)
* (Recommended) `linux` - Linux native x86_64 executable. ~50% reduced memory usage and instant startup
* `git` - Locally builds and runs the proxy from source in Java
  * Requires Java 21+, plus [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed and the repository cloned.


### DNS Setup

* To use a domain name you need the following DNS records:
  * an `A` record to your IP address
  * an `SRV` record for `_minecraft._tcp` with the port and the `A` record as its target. [Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/971140948593635335/1139099459431698463/firefox_GSnrLzpsR3.png)

### Discord Bot Setup

* Create a discord bot here: [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/)
* Enable `Message Content Intent` under the "Bot" tab.
* Invite the discord bot to a server.
* Create a role for users to manage the proxy, a channel to manage the 
  proxy in, and a channel for the chat relay. The bot's role must have permissions to send and receive messages in both channels
* Run `setup.py` or edit these`config.json` properties:
  * `enable` -> set to `true`
  * `token` -> the bot's discord token
  * `channelId` -> the channel ID where you will manage the proxy from
  * `accountOwnerRoleId` -> a discord role ID that allows managing sensitive configuration like the whitelist
  * `chatRelay.channelId` -> The channel ID where the MC server chat relay will be sent and received from.

## Run

* `./launch.sh` (Linux) or `.\launch.bat` (Windows)
* The discord prefix is `.` by default. e.g. `.connect` or `.disconnect`.
* Type `.help` in discord or `help` in the interactive terminal to get a list of available commands.

To set custom JVM args, (e.g. to change the max heap size) edit `custom_jvm_args` in `launch_config.json`

## AutoUpdater

The AutoUpdater is enabled by default. It updates both ZenithProxy and the launcher script. 

It can be enabled/disabled in `launch_config.json`:
* ZenithProxy AutoUpdater: `auto_update`. Can also be configured with the command `autoUpdate off` (with `.` prefix if in discord).
* Launcher AutoUpdater: `auto_update_launcher`

To use an exact version, in `launch_config.json` set `auto_update` to `false` and `version` to the desired version (e.g. `1.0.0+java`).
